# Machine-Learning-Lottery-Prediction
Machine Learning code in Python/Keras.

This is just an exercise to put in practice the knowledge learned in Deep Learning Specialization at Coursera (Andrew Ng).

The task chosen was to predict the next game in a brazilian lottery called Mega Sena (6 balls drawn from a spining bowl with 60 balls numbered from 1 to 60). As the propability is equal for each ball, the neural network can't predict. But who knows if there is a pattern...? lol
